Test the following scenarios:

**{{args}}**

## Testing Process

### 1. **Check Tools**
- Check if Playwright MCP is available
- If available, use Playwright MCP for automated testing and screenshots
- If not available, proceed with manual testing

### 2. **Execute Tests**
For each scenario:
- Go through the test steps
- Take a screenshot at each important step
- Note if the test passes or fails

### 3. **Create Report**
Save a simple test report to `tasks/reports/test-report.md`:

```markdown
# Test Report

## Test Results
### Scenario 1: [Name]
- Status: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
- Screenshots: screenshot1.png, screenshot2.png
- Notes: [Any issues found]

### Scenario 2: [Name]
- Status: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL  
- Screenshots: screenshot3.png, screenshot4.png
- Notes: [Any issues found]

## Summary
- Total tests: [number]
- Passed: [number]
- Failed: [number]

## Screenshots
All screenshots saved in tasks/reports/screenshots/
```

### 4. **File Organization**
```
tasks/
└── reports/
    ├── test-report.md
    └── screenshots/
        ├── screenshot1.png
        ├── screenshot2.png
        └── ...
```

## Key Points
- **Use Playwright MCP if available** for consistent testing
- **Take screenshots as evidence** for each test step
