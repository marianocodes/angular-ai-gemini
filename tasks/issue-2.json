Add a ToDo:\n\nGiven a user is on the ToDo list page,\n\nWhen they type a task description into the input field (e.g., \"Buy groceries\") and click the \"Add\" button (or press Enter),\n\nThen the new task should appear at the end of the ToDo list.\n\nAnd the input field should be cleared.\n\n2. View ToDo List:\n\nGiven there are existing ToDos,\n\nWhen the user views the page,\n\nThen they should see a vertically-aligned list of all their tasks.\n\nAnd each task item must display a checkbox on the left and the task description text next to it.\n\n3. Mark a ToDo as Complete:\n\nGiven an incomplete task is in the list,\n\nWhen the user clicks the checkbox next to the task,\n\nThen the checkbox should become checked.\n\nAnd a visual indicator (e.g., a strikethrough line) should be applied to the task's text to signify completion.\n\nAnd clicking the checkbox again should revert the task to its incomplete state.\n\n4. Delete a ToDo:\n\nGiven a task exists in the list,\n\nWhen the user clicks a \"Delete\" icon/button associated with that task,\n\nThen the task should be permanently removed from the list.\n\nTechnical Notes & Implementation Details\nUI Components:\n\nInput Form: An input element of type text for the task description and a button to submit.\n\nList Container: A ul or div to hold the list of ToDo items.\n\nToDo Item: A list item (li) component containing a checkbox, the task text, and a delete button.\n\nState Management: The application's state must hold an array of ToDo objects. Each object should have at least an id (unique identifier), a text (string), and a isCompleted (boolean) property.\n\nStyling: Completed items should have a distinct style (e.g., text-decoration: line-through;, color: grey;).",
